The Party has created\na propagandistic language known as Newspeak, which is designed to limit free thought and promote the\nPartys doctrines.

He belongs to the Outer Party, and his job is to rewrite\nhistory in the Ministry of Truth, bringing it in line with current political thinking. However, Winstons\nlonging for truth and decency leads him to secretly rebel against the government.

Winston also becomes increasingly interested in the Brotherhood, a group of\ndissenters.

	p("Short story anthologies can be difficult for me to get into, especially ones that arent serial.\nMany times a good story feels over before its even begun, and then I have to move on to a new one\nand meet new characters in a new setting. Short stories can be enthralling, capable of telling a simple\ntale without establishing a universe or communicating every thought in a characters mind as so\nmany works of lengthy fiction tend to do these days. An overbearing level of emotion can be expressed\nin very few pages with short stories. My problem is with having to read many short stories all at once.\nI feel that I can only appreciate short stories if I take them one at a time. For a non-serial anthology,\nthats hard for me to do because I dont like to sit on a single book for too long. Ray Bradbury is\nconsidered by many to be the master of American short fiction. Even aside from his short stories,\nunlike dozens of other science fiction authors, his novel-length works are extremely brief. His best-known\npieces such as Fahrenheit 451 and Something Wicked This Way Comes are short and sweet, and among many\nfavorites in modern American sci-fi and fantasy. But for Bradburys biggest fans, his greatest strengths\nlie in his short stories. His anthology, The Martian Chronicles, is among the most popular collections\nof short stories in science fiction literature. However, The Martian Chronicles is also serial,\nand while each story deals with individual charming characters, the mastery\nof it all is in the over-arching story. ");

Crawford traces the story back to the remote rain forests of Africa - home to the primates\nthat carry the ancestral virus - and reveals how HIV-1 first jumped from chimpanzees to humans in rural\nsouth east Cameroon. Examining how this happened, and how it then travelled back to Colonial west\ncentral Africa where it eventually exploded as a pandemic, she asks why and how it was able to spread\nso widely. From hospital intensive care wards to research laboratories and the African rain forests, this\nis the wide-ranging story of a killer virus and a tale of scientific endeavour.");
